#### **Welcome to Kabir's AI to BIO Lab (A2B)**
<!-- Welcome to the **Kabir's AI to BIO Lab (A2B)**.<br/> -->
We advance **Artificial intelligence (AI)** and **Computational Biology** research by designing and developing robust, explainable and accessible **Machine Learning (ML)** algorithms for solving complex **Molecular Biology** problems.

#### **Mission**
We seek the truth and knowledge of what is encoded in the language of life through computational modeling and data-driven discovery. 

#### **Vision**
Our vision is to build a world where AI-driven molecular insights will enable a deep understanding of biology, accurate disease prediction, rapid personalized drug design for effective and timely treatments for each patient. 

#### **Goals**
We relentlessly aim to achieve the following goals:
1. Discover fundamental biological truths
2. Advance AI algorithms to model molecules and their interactions
3. Accelerate precision medicine 
4. Bridge Computer Science and Molecular Biology to reveal new insights
5. Ensure computational advances translate into clinical settings

### **Future**
The fusion of computer science and molecular biology has opened new avenues for decoding the complex language of life. AI is now driving rapid advancements in the study of biological systems. Algorithms can analyze vast omics data, detect patterns, and simulate molecular interactions that once required decades of laboratory work. We believe future AI-driven insights will advance our understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and pave the way for novel treatments.

<!-- ### What do we do?
I develop novel AI and ML algorithms to advance scientific discovery and understanding of biological systems. I would largely characterize my current research as AI for Molecular Biology. My recent interests hybridize concepts and ideas from machine learning, deep learning, language models, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. My research objective is to advance the language models situated in domain knowledge to leverage content, structure and organization of diverse data sources. -->
